# Calculator

This project is a simple calculator built with HTML and JavaScript. The HTML file contains the structure of the calculator, including buttons for numbers, operations, and a backspace button. The JavaScript file handles the functionality of the calculator, including displaying numbers, performing calculations, clearing the display, and implementing the backspace feature to remove the last entered character.

The backspace button is added to allow users to erase the most recent input, and the calculator supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

This separation of HTML and JavaScript into different files ensures better organization and maintainability of the code.
